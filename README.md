## What is BeKind? 🐶
> BeKind is an interactive application where children learn how a small act of kindness can make a difference in someone else's day, while also immersing themselves in educational activities that reinforce these valuable principles!

> Developed in SwiftUI, this year it was selected as one of the winners of the #SwiftStudentChallenge2024, highlighting that all elements and characters were designed and created from scratch by myself! 🙆🏻‍♀️

## Features 🧑‍💻
- SwiftUI: for the creation of interfaces, data flow, animations, window navigation, and other factors
- Adobe Ilustrator: used to create all the visual elements found within the application, with the purpose of maintaining a consistent theme throughout
